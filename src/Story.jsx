    <p>
    Life experience has helped make me a genuinely nice person who understands that getting to know people is the key to success.
    </p>
    <p>
    Over the past 20 years I have had leadership roles in Hospitality, Service, Finance and IT.   
    </p>
    <p>
    This wealth of experience allows me to bring successful skills, practices and knowledge from those sectors with me. It also demonstrates my comfort to continually learn, adapt and work with a diverse cross-section of society.
    </p>
    <p>
    At work I am most passionate about fostering 'a culture of teamwork', where the customer experience and staff engagement are a team's measure of success.
    </p>
    <p>
    I excel because people can tell I genuinely care.
